# Lab 1

1. Write a C program that meets the following requirements:
* Declares variables of the correct types for your age in years and your GPA, sets values for these (I do not care whether the age and GPA are accurate!), and uses printf with formatting codes to print a message like 
 John is 27 years old and has a GPA of 4.0
* Declares a constant value for PI and calculates and prints the circumference of a circle with radius 10
* Creates an enum for weather with several different values (for example, RAIN, WIND, and SUNSHINE), creates a variable of this type and sets a value for it, and then uses a switch to print out a message that depends on the weather type (for example, the switch could print "wear a raincoat" if the actual weather is RAIN and "enjoy the day" ni case of SUNSHINE )
* Compiles successfully with `gcc` in Fedora 26 using the flag `std=c11`
